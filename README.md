### About this document

Design guidelines can be an important tool for creating visually appealing, intuitive, insightful dashboards. However, they are not meant to be a strict set of rules that must be followed at all times. Instead, they serve as a source of inspiration and guidance, helping to make informed decisions while still allowing for creativity and innovation. This should be seen as a flexible framework for design that takes into account the goals, values, and needs of the report and its users.
