### About this document

Design guidelines can be an important tool for creating visually appealing, intuitive, insightful dashboards. However, they are not meant to be a strict set of rules that must be followed at all times. Instead, they serve as a source of inspiration and guidance, helping to make informed decisions while still allowing for creativity and innovation. This should be seen as a flexible framework for design that takes into account the goals, values, and needs of the report and its users.

### Essential
- Prioritize the data and forget the fluff.
- Reports consider the utility in answering a question or solving a problem.

### Impactful
- Offers insights in the first 3, 30, and 300 seconds.
- Enables the user to reach their goal and explore the subject in detail by using a clear system of filters, functions, and established interaction patterns that make the affordance unmistakable.

### Intuitive
- Communicates the important story in a clear, concise, easy-to-understand way.
- A definite structure, contrast, rhythm and hierarchy guides users through complex information.
- The final result respects the time required by the audience being asked to experience it.
