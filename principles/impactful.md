# Impactful reports tell the user exactly what they need to know.
> **The report should answer critical business questions by selecting metrics that directly tie to actionable outcomes.** Rather than showing all available data, focus on measurements that can influence decisions or highlight areas for improvement. For example, instead of displaying raw transaction counts, show conversion rates that could indicate where to optimize the customer journey.

Visualization choices should emphasize significant patterns, trends, or anomalies that warrant attention. This means selecting chart types that best communicate the story in your data - like using line charts to highlight concerning trends over time, or scatter plots to reveal important correlations between metrics.
The analysis should guide the viewer toward clear conclusions by providing appropriate context and comparisons.
