# Interaction Placement
> Elegantly and inutitively placing interactions

### Groups that tailor the view
#### Is the content better understood if already filtered?
- If the user's eyes should land on the configuration options first, as it would increase their user experience, place the filter pane on the left side of the page.
- If the user would want to initially take in the content, then perform actions / customize it, place it on the right side of the page.
