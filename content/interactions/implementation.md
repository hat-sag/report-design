> Bookmarks, field parameters, and slicer buttons

Use tabbed navigation when you have a few main sections that users need to switch between quickly. Tabs work best on smaller screens, like mobile devices, and when the content is closely related, such as different categories in a product listingâ€”but can become cramped or call for scrolling if there are too many tabs. 

Choose a sidebar menu when you have more options or detailed subcategories. Sidebars work well for complex apps or websites where users need to explore many sections without feeling overwhelmed. Sidebars are also great for desktop layouts, where you have more screen space to display a list of options.
