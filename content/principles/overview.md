# Designing for Usability

>Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design. They are called "heuristics" because they are broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines.

### Match Between the System and the Real World
> **The design should speak the users' language.**  
Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

Terms, concepts, icons, and images that seem perfectly clear to you and your colleagues may be unfamiliar or confusing to your users. When a design’s controls follow real-world conventions and correspond to desired outcomes, it’s easier for users to learn and remember how the interface works. This helps to build an experience that feels **intuitive**.

- Ensure that users can understand meaning without having to go look up a word’s definition.
- Never assume your understanding of words or concepts will match that of your users.

### User Control and Freedom
> **Users often perform actions by mistake.**   
They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process.

When it's easy for people to back out of a process or undo an action, it fosters a sense of freedom and confidence. Exits allow users to remain in control of the system and avoid getting stuck and feeling frustrated.

- Support Undo and Redo.
- Show a clear way to exit the current interaction, like a Cancel button.
- Make sure the exit is clearly labeled and discoverable.

### Consistency and Standards
> **Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.**  
Follow Aline platform and industry conventions.

Jakob's Law states that people spend most of their time using digital products other than yours. Users’ experiences with those other products set their expectations. Failing to maintain consistency may increase the users' cognitive load by forcing them to learn something new.

### Recognition Rather than Recall
>**Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible.**  
The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed.

Humans have limited short-term memories. Interfaces that promote recognition reduce the amount of cognitive effort required from users.
- Let people recognize information in the interface, rather than forcing them to remember (“recall”) it.
- Offer help in context, instead of giving users a long tutorial to memorize.
- Reduce the information that users have to remember.

### Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
> **Allow for customization, so users can make selections about how they want the product to work.**  
Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

Flexible processes can be carried out in different ways, so that people can pick whichever method works for them.

### Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
> **Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed.**  
Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

This heuristic doesn't mean you have to use a flat design — it's about making sure you're keeping the content and visual design focused on the essentials. Ensure that the visual elements of the interface support the user's primary goals.
- Keep the content and visual design of UI focused on the essentials.
- Don't let unnecessary elements distract users from the information they really need.
- Prioritize the content and features to support primary goals.
